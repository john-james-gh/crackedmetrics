## Dev Environment Tips

- Use `pnpm dlx nx show projects` to see all available projects in your workspace.
- Use `pnpm dlx nx run <project_name>:<target>` to run specific targets for a project (e.g., `pnpm dlx nx run dashboard:test`).
- Use `pnpm dlx nx graph` to visualize project dependencies and understand the workspace structure.
- Use `pnpm format` to run prettier.
- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right nameâ€”skip the top-level one.

- After moving files or changing imports, run `pnpm dlx nx run <project_name>:lint` to be sure ESLint rules still pass.
- After moving files or changing imports, run `pnpm dlx nx run <project_name>:typecheck` to be sure TypeScript compiler still passes.
