## Dev Environment Tips

- Use `nx show projects` to see all available projects in your workspace.
- Use `nx run <project_name>:<target>` to run specific targets for a project (e.g., `nx run dashboard:test`).
- Use `nx graph` to visualize project dependencies and understand the workspace structure.
- Use `pnpm format` to run prettier.
- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right nameâ€”skip the top-level one.
- cm (short for Cracked Metrics) is an internal CLI that uploads test results after test runner finishes.
